# TradeVision AI

TradeVision AI is an advanced web application designed for financial analysis, integrating TradingView and custom D3.js charts. The app provides a rich set of tools for traders to analyze market data, with added features that leverage a custom-built agent to generate trading signals based on both price action and volume data.

## Features

- **Dual Charting:**
  - Easily toggle between TradingView's advanced charts and custom D3.js charts for different analytical perspectives.

- **TradeVision Agent:**
  - A custom agent that analyzes price action and volume data to identify trends, breakouts, and other key trading signals.
  - The agent generates real-time trading signals based on a combination of moving averages (10, 100, 200) and volume spikes.
  - Users can interact with the agent via API endpoints to retrieve the current trend, detect volume spikes, or get trading signals.

- **Volume-Enhanced Analysis:**
  - Incorporates volume data in the analysis, allowing for more accurate trend confirmation and breakout verification.
  - The agent monitors volume spikes to confirm the strength of price movements.

- **Interactive Interface:**
  - A web-based interface built using Flask that allows users to visualize market data and interact with the TradeVision Agent.
  - Users can retrieve real-time signals through a simple API, making it easy to integrate the agent's analysis into other tools or platforms.

- **JSON Data Integration:**
  - The application uses JSON-formatted data files for storing and processing historical price and volume data.
  - Data files are placed in the `static/data` directory for easy access and updating.

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that you have Python installed, and install the required packages using:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Place Data Files:**
   - Ensure that your data files, such as `3_months_usd_jpy_data_with_volume.json`, are located in the `static/data` directory.

3. **Run the Application:**
   - Start the Flask application by running:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

4. **Access the Application:**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the interface.

## API Endpoints

- **`/api/signal`**: Retrieves the current trading signal generated by the TradeVision Agent based on the latest price and volume data.

## Project Structure

- **`app.py`**: The main application file that runs the Flask web server.
- **`agent.py`**: Contains the TradeVision Agent logic, responsible for analyzing data and generating trading signals.
- **`static/data`**: Directory where JSON data files are stored.
- **`templates/index.html`**: The main HTML file for the web interface.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expanded Indicator Support:**
  - Integration of additional technical indicators, such as RSI or MACD, to further refine trading signals.
- **Real-time Data Integration:**
  - Implementing real-time data feeds to enhance the agent's decision-making process.
- **User Customization:**
  - Allowing users to customize the agent's parameters, such as moving average periods or volume spike thresholds.
